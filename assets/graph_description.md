### Autonomous Sensing Powered by Sensever Alfa
The above graph shows a live feed of temperature data and pressure data at the [Alfa Laval Innovation House](https://www.alfalaval.dk/info/denmark/innovation-house/) in SÃ¸borg, Denmark. Using the ["SensEver Alfa"](https://www.tegnology.dk/sensever-alfa/) power supply from [TEGnology ApS](https://www.tegnology.dk/), we can convert an arbitrary temperature difference (generated here via a hot plate) into a steady 3.3V power supply which we then use to power a Lorawan transmitter connected to a temperature sensor and an [ABB pressure sensor](https://new.abb.com/products/measurement-products/pressure/gauge-pressure-transmitters/261gs-gauge-pressure-transmitter). The data is continuously transmitted via a nearby connected [LoRaWAN gateway](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/gateways/models/thethingsindoorgateway/) to the [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) platform. We store the data using [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) and display it in this [python powered dashboard](https://github.com/Dahlia-Dry/TEGnology-abb-dashboard) hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home).
